# GoogleMapsImplementation

This is a simple maps project that does the following
 - It uses names of places to automatically pick coordinates of that place
 - It pins all those locations on a Google Map represented by a custom Icon
 - It labels all icons with the name of the developer and language they use to code
 
 Please note that; this is a static implementation of maps but can be modified to be dynamic.
